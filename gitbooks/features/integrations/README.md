# Third-party Integrations (118+)

OpenHuman ships with backend-proxied access to **118+ third-party services**. Connecting any of them is a one-click OAuth flow inside the app, there are no API keys to wire by hand, and no plugin marketplace to navigate.

(Under the hood, the connector layer is powered by [Composio](https://composio.dev). You will not need to think about it.)

Once a service is connected, it shows up in four places at once:

1. As an **agent tool**, the model can call it directly.
2. As a **memory source**, [auto-fetch](../obsidian-wiki/auto-fetch.md) syncs it into the [Memory Tree](../obsidian-wiki/memory-tree.md) every twenty minutes.
3. As a **profile signal**, your activity across services feeds your personalization.
4. As a **trigger source**, live events (a new email, a new charge, an inbound DM) flow into the [Triggers](triggers.md) pipeline and can fire off agent actions automatically.

## Some of what's in the catalog

The catalog spans productivity, business, social, messaging and Google. A non-exhaustive sample:

| Category                | Examples                                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email & calendar**    | Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar      |
| **Docs & storage**      | Google Docs, Google Drive, Notion, Dropbox, Airtable |
| **Code & dev**          | GitHub, Linear, Jira, Figma                          |
| **Comms**               | Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp  |
| **CRM & sales**         | Salesforce, HubSpot                                  |
| **Commerce & payments** | Stripe, Shopify                                      |
| **Project management**  | Asana, Trello                                        |
| **Social**              | Twitter / X, Spotify, YouTube                        |

## Native vs proxied

Some services have **native providers**. Rust modules that know how to ingest the service into the Memory Tree directly (e.g. Gmail's native ingest path). Others are exposed as **proxied tools** only: the agent can call them, but there's no automatic ingest yet. New native providers are added as features land.

## Advanced direct API connectors

Most integrations use one-click OAuth through OpenHuman's backend. Some self-hosted systems are better wired directly because you already own the server and API key.

The first direct API connector is **n8n**. It exposes read-only agent access to workflows and execution history through n8n's public `/api/v1` API.

```toml
[n8n]
enabled = true
base_url = "https://n8n.example.com"
api_key = "..."
```

You can also configure it with environment variables:

```bash
OPENHUMAN_N8N_BASE_URL=https://n8n.example.com
OPENHUMAN_N8N_API_KEY=...
```

Private HTTP URLs are allowed for local and tailnet deployments, for example `http://127.0.0.1:5678` or `http://100.x.y.z:5678`. Public HTTP URLs are rejected because the n8n API key would be sent in plaintext.

## How connections work

Click **Connect** on any integration. A browser window opens for OAuth. Once you sign in, the connection becomes active and OpenHuman starts syncing it through [auto-fetch](../obsidian-wiki/auto-fetch.md) on the next 20-minute tick.

Each integration shows its current status:

* **Not connected**. integration has not been set up.
* **Connected**. integration is active and being synced.
* **Manage**. active integration with options to reconfigure or disconnect.

You can revoke any connection at any time from the Skills tab.

## Messaging channels

Three integrations are special. OpenHuman uses them to _talk back_ to you, not just read from them:

* **Telegram**. the primary messaging channel. Two-way: send and receive messages, manage chats, search history, create groups, 80+ actions on your behalf. All actions run through your own encrypted credentials.
* **Discord**. send and receive messages via Discord. Connect your account to receive OpenHuman messages there.
* **Web**. a browser-based chat interface within the desktop app. Messages stay entirely local.

Set your default under **Settings → Automation & Channels → Messaging Channels**. The active route status shows which channel is currently in use. Telegram offers two credential modes: connect via OpenHuman (one-click, encrypted) or provide your own credentials for maximum control.

## Skills

Beyond third-party services, OpenHuman has **skills**, small sandboxed modules that run inside the app, fetch external data, run on a schedule, transform information, and respond to events. Each runs with enforced resource limits. Skills install from the Skills tab and integrate with the same Memory Tree as everything else.

## Native voice and tools

Two capabilities ship native rather than as integrations because they're load-bearing for the desktop experience:

* [**Voice**](../native-tools/voice.md). STT in, TTS out, plus a live Google Meet agent that joins meetings, transcribes them into your Memory Tree, and can speak back into the call.
* [**Native tools**](../native-tools/README.md). built-in web search, web-fetch scraper, and a full filesystem/git/lint/test/grep coder toolset that the agent uses out of the box.

## Privacy boundary

OpenHuman's OAuth integrations go through the OpenHuman backend, which handles OAuth tokens and rate limiting. Direct API connectors such as n8n are opt-in and use credentials you configure on your own device or deployment. The agent only sees the _results_ of tool calls, not the credentials.

See [Privacy & Security](../privacy-and-security.md) for the full boundary.
